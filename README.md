# Password_Checker
Checks whether your password have ever been leaked in any of the data breaches or not


It uses a API from "haveibeenpwned" which gives the data of the passwords that have been leaked in breaches.

In this your password is never sent to the server. So, there is no tension of any data breach over any data transmission.
It uses SHA1 Encoding.
